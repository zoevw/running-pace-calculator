# running-pace-calculator


Have you ever wondered how fast your pace should be if you have a goal finish time for a particular distance or race?

Pace calculators are useful for runners of all skill level. This program is designed to help runners calculate their pace, time, or distance for a run, given two known fields. The user has the option to have their calculations done in either miles or kilometers.  

Whether youâ€™re running your first race, trying to PR, or going on a training run, knowing your pace enables you to train and run better.
