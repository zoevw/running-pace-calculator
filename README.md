# running-pace-calculator

**What is the purpose?
This program is designed to help runners calculate their pace, time, or distance for a run, given two known fields. The user has the option to have their calculations done in either miles or kilometers. 

Pace calculators are useful for both new runners and expert runners. Whether youâ€™re running your first race, trying to PR, or going on a training run, knowing your pace can help you train and run better.

Determine how fast your pace should be if you have a certain finish time for a desired distance or race. For example, find out what pace you need to keep to run a 28-minute 5K or a sub-2:00 half marathon.
Determine what your pace was for your training run around the neighborhood or track. For example, find out how fast your pace was for that 46-minute 5-mile training run.
Determine the distance you ran. For example, you can calculate the distance you ran by inputting the pace you ran at and the duration of your training run or race
